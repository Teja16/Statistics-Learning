Why Statistics?
Historically the statistic methods are designed to solve numerical evidencing problems.
Eg:
1. If i put more fertilizer in a field how much more crop should i expect to get?
2. Did this particualr medicine improve the health condition of a patient?
3. Does this data that comes from telescope gives evidence of a new planet? or is just a normal night sky? or is this a new kind of astronomical object that has come by?
Statistical methods have also been used to simply describe what has been seen.
